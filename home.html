                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Manuel GÃ³mez. I'm a 20 year old university student of Mechatronic engineering. Even when my main field of study is
                        mechatronics, I'm also passionate about programming, with some certifications in python. I'm constantly learning new
                        things, right now I'm learning about full-stack development, as well as some things in Machine Learning and Data Science.
                        My goal is to learn everything I can about technology so I can bring all my wonderful software ideas to life.
                    </p>
